Brain tumors feature among the most lethal illnesses; this ends up they may grow given the tissue of the brain
inside the skull begins to grow evolves at once and uncontrollably. It could be cancerous or benign. Malignant tumors
have the ability to propagate rapidly throughout the brain’s surrounding tissue, while benign tumors grow more
slowly. However, benign tumors have the potential to be dangerous because, as they grow, they may cause damage to
nearby brain regions. 70% of all tumors are actually benign, while 30% tend to be malignant. Pituitary tumors
are another kind of tumor that arises from brain cells in the brain’s pituitary gland growing too quickly. Thus, early
detection is essential because brain tumors are fatal.
